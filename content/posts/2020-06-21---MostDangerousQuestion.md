You applied for a job and kept on waiting very patiently for the call. Finally, you received a call for an interview and the day comes when you enter a room of strangers with a formal setting. You are sitting across the table and the first question is asked "TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF'' and you are tongue tied. You have no idea what to say? This is your first impression and if it is ruined, you will never get a second chance to make it. This is the time to brainwash your interviewer and make him realize that you are the one he is looking for.
Here, the interviewer is not interested in your personal life. He does not want to know the name of your parents and pets. Most of the time, people end up saying "well, my hobby is reading books and watching TV" or ''I like reading books, I have many friends and I like partying with them" etc. This is not the right way to answer this question. We see hundreds and thousands of people struggle with this question. You should be well prepared for this special occasion.

First of all, you should be clear why this question is asked? as the interviewer already has your CV in front of him. What does he want to know about you? To answer this question you have to understand the perspective of the hiring manager or CEO of the company. By asking this question, he wants to know two things only.

**1. What are you bringing to this organization?** Employer wants to know your qualification and experience.

**2. What will you contribute to problem solving in this organization?**
There are some tips and tricks to answer this question effectively as in the first few minutes, employer will decide whether he is going to hire you or not. He will assess your attitude towards work and your benefit for the company.

**TIP 1:** Formal Greetings

Always start with formal greetings e.g Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. Do not fumble between good morning and good after noon. Never say Hello, Hey and Hi and also say thankyou for this opportunity before answering this first question.

**TIP 2:** Be Natural

Be natural but do not share everything about yourself. This is your first time so present your best self. Make only those statements which are beneficial for the company.

**TIP 3:** Do not talk about personal life

Never discuss your habits and personal life choices in response to this question. Your hiring manager does not want to know your personal story as it is not going to contribute to his organization.

**TIP 4:** Give a summary of your qualifications and experience.

Tell them the story of your professional work experience and it has to be complete, compelling, engaging and clear. Conclude by explaining current position.
