## HARDWOOD FLOORING

The floor of any area is its defining feature. These days the most popular flooring for homes and offices is hardwood flooring. Its popularity has a number of reasons as its beautiful, naturally inviting and timeless material. Hardwood flooring looks very traditional but many new homes are using laminate flooring which offers a natural look similar to wood but at a lower price.
Hardwood Flooring is made of harvested trees. Its price depends on the type of wood you choose. Hardwood is susceptible to scratching and can get damaged from excessive moisture. But, hardwood is a real deal. It is beautiful and adds value to your home.  Hardwood can be repaired by sanding imperfections and refinishing. This gives it an edge over laminate, in that it will last for years.


## TYPES OF HARDWOOD FLOORING

Do not confuse floor type with wood variety. There are three main types of hardwood floor

1-  Solid Wood Flooring: 
Solid wood flooring comes in three main types
Strip Flooring: Strip Flooring is denoted by the thickness and width of wood planks. It has a set width but the thickness can vary.
Plank Flooring: Plank Flooring comes in two thicknesses and width can vary.
Parquet Flooring: These floors have a very different look from typical hardwood. They are composed of wood slats and made up of geometrical patterns.


2- Engineered Flooring:

Engineered flooring is produced by adhering layers of laminate veneer with real wood. The main difference with this sort of wood and laminate flooring is that laminate flooring contains no actual wood.






3- Acrylic-Impregnated Wood Flooring:

Acrylic-Impregnated Wood Flooring is infused with sealant and colour throughout the thickness of the wood. This type of flooring is used in commercial, not residential projects because it is very hard and highly resistant to moisture and scratches. 








                                            **TYPES OF WOOD**

Another crucial decision is to choose the wood type. There are no hard and fast rules. Simply select what strikes you and fits into your budget. There are different types of wood given below  and they vary in prices

Red Oak
White Oak
Birch
Pine
Cherry
Douglas Fir
Bamboo
Maple
Rosewood
Walnut
Ash
When pricing the different flooring options, it is important to remember that flooring is priced by square foot. It's a good idea to get measurement first. Once you know the square footage of the area to be covered, you will be able to estimate the cost.




## LAMINATE WOOD FLOORING

Laminate flooring is made of compound wood compressed together at high temperature. The image of hardwood is then placed on composite wood, covering it to form the laminate. This flooring has a wide range of designs that gives a feel of beautiful ceramic tiles, hardwood, and slate.the material and the installation cost of laminate flooring are less than hardwood flooring but the exact price depends on the cost of material and the size of a house. It is very resistant to scuffs and scratches as it has a hard layer on top. While it can withstand moisture better than hardwood, it should not be in a regularly wet area. Because of its top layer, laminate flooring does not fade with sunlight and can be used safely in rooms with large windows.

## VINYL FLOORING


Vinyl is a fully synthetic floor made from layers of PVC & fiber glass. These materials are easy to produce, making this type of flooring incredibly cheap, especially when compared to solid wood flooring & engineered wood. It's easy to install, often waterproof and designed to replicate more expensive wood style. In America this type of flooring is very common in kitchens, bathrooms and in entry areas. Now it is becoming very popular in Pakistan as well.
