## 7 signs that indicate that You simply lack emotional intelligence

Not everything is an IQ in life, and your emotional abilities play an equally important role in how your life will look. 
Emotional intelligence might not have received equivalent fame as IQ, but today researchers are already realizing that  you do not need to be geniuses to succeed. In fact, the facility of emotional intelligence (EQ) is so high that researchers claim it's critical to success.

This is a comparatively new field of psychological research, and intrinsically its definition remains forming and changing very often. However, it is often said generally that when emotional intelligence is claimed to mean an individual's ability to acknowledge, appreciate, and manage his or her feelings and feelings of others with whom he is interacting.

Emotional intelligence is not  a tangible thing, but it does affect our behavior, helps us navigate social complexities, and helps us make personal decisions. In contrast to IQ that's determined at a comparatively young age, emotional intelligence can develop over the years, following life experiences we accumulate.




### 1. You feel misunderstood repeatedly

When your emotional intelligence is comparatively low, your encounter with people is harder. The main reason is that you simply fail to precise yourself during a way that others understand. That, by the way, doesn't mean that folks with emotional intelligence always manage to speak easily, they simply learn from their mistakes and they properly communicate to suit the person facing them.

### 2. You don't know what really drives you

Each folk has one button that, if pressed, will turn us on and make us behave impulsively or in anger. If you're not conscious of it, it'll be difficult for you to disable it. People with high emotional intelligence are conscious of these buttons, so albeit they fail to stop their next outburst, they're going to make an attempt to not reach the corners, where others actually control them.

### 3. You are never angry

Emotional intelligence isn't about being nice, it's about trying to urge you to manage your emotions to urge the simplest results. a part of managing emotions is additionally revealing your true feelings, albeit they're anger or frustration.

### 4. You blame others for what you are feeling

Our emotions come from within us, so we are solely liable for them. it's going to be tempting to blame others for the way we feel, but choosing to cast our feelings on others only ultimately hinders us.

### 5. You are squeamish

If you think about yourself and who you are, there is no reason people can easily hurt you. People with high intelligence are confident, open-minded, and self-deprecating - they're not afraid to travel down because they understand.

### 6. You don't abandon of mistakes

In this case, the two extremes aren't good: if you linger over mistakes you've got made for an extended time it can cause stress and anxiety, and if you forget them - you're doomed to repeat them. People with high emotional intelligence attempt to keep things balanced: they put the error aside, but leave it close enough to find out from it for next time. This ability helps them turn failure into success and brings them back to their feet.

### 7. You are resentful

The negative emotions that overwhelm you once you hold resentment are a source of stress and pressure and that they cause your body to travel into a fight-or-flight state. this might be good in cases where your survival depends thereon, but when it doesn't, it just puts your body in distress and stress - and you already know what it does to your health.
