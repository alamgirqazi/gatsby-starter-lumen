## 7 signs that indicate that You simply lack emotional intelligence

Not everything is an IQ in life, and your emotional abilities play an equally important role in how your life will look. 
Emotional intelligence might not have received equivalent fame as IQ, but today researchers are already realizing that  you do not need to be geniuses to succeed. In fact, the facility of emotional intelligence (EQ) is so high that researchers claim it's critical to success.

This is a comparatively new field of psychological research, and intrinsically its definition remains forming and changing very often. However, it is often said generally that when emotional intelligence is claimed to mean an individual's ability to acknowledge, appreciate, and manage his or her feelings and feelings of others with whom he is interacting.

Emotional intelligence is not  a tangible thing, but it does affect our behavior, helps us navigate social complexities, and helps us make personal decisions. In contrast to IQ that's determined at a comparatively young age, emotional intelligence can develop over the years, following life experiences we accumulate.
