## The science behind superfoods: Are these foods really super?

Superfoods are mostly plant-based foods but also some dairy and fish, that are considered to be good for our health. Blueberries, salmon, kale, and acai are just a few samples of foods that have garnered the "superfood" label. However, there aren't any set criteria for determining what's and what's not a superfood.

The term 'superfood' has become a well-liked fashion word in food and health jargon. However, there's no technical definition of this idea and mostly positive - effects of those foods do not always apply to the particular diet. 

### The origin of superfood

The concept of superfood may be a popular concept when it involves food and health. The media are filled with reports on many ultra-healthy foods, from blueberries and beets to cocoa and salmon. These reports, which claim to reflect the newest scientific evidence, guarantee that these foods provide the healthy effect on our body and keep disease and aging away. But are these reports reality?

### What is the proof?

It is important to look carefully at the scientific evidence behind the media's superfood claims to differentiate the reality from the very fact . Blueberry, one among the foremost popular and best known superfoods, is usually explored by scientists who are interested in its health-related properties. it's reported that a gaggle of antioxidant plant components,especially anthocyanins, in blueberries both prevent and destroy the event of colon cells in people with cancer. Blueberries also are rich in other antioxidants that are proven to stop age-related memory attenuation and reject this attenuation.

Antioxidants are molecules that protect cells within the body from harmful free radicals. These free radicals come from sources like cigarettes and alcohol and are naturally produced by the metabolism within the body. An excessive amount of radical within the body can cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes cell disruption, which may cause age-related diseases like cancer, diabetes and heart condition .

Other fruits included within the status of super food include acai strawberries and pomegranate. Although the potential positive effect on human health has not been confirmed yet, it's been demonstrated that acai pulp has very strong antioxidant properties. Researches on pomegranate juice show that pomegranate juice can both lower vital signs and reduce oxidative stress during a short time in healthy people. Both of those are important risk factors for heart condition .

Just like pomegranate juice, beets are recommended as super food for heart health. It's been claimed that the high nitrate levels it contains are often converted into oxide by the physical body . Oxide has been proven to scale back vital signs and blood coagulation tendency in humans, among other things. Cocoa is likewise imagined to reduce the danger of heart condition by lowering vital signs and increasing flexibility of blood vessels. The rationale for this is often thought to be the high amount of flavonoid components found in cocoa. Finally, salmon is additionally often included within the list of superfoods. This is often thanks to increased evidence that omega-3 fatty acids found in salmon and other fatty fish can both prevent heart problems in people with high cardiovascular risk and reduce joint pain experienced by patients with atrophic arthritis .

### Take a better look

These are just a couple of the various studies that examine the health effects of food. At  first glance, these studies seem to support the presence of some superfoods. Of course, the nutrients contained in these foods have proven to possess health-promoting properties. But a better look reveals the problem of applying the results of those studies to the particular diet. This is often because the laboratory conditions under which food research is conducted are often very different from the conditions during which these foods are consumed daily by humans.

<figure class="float-right" style="width: 240px" height="150px">

An important feature of research during this area is that the tendency to use nutrients at high levels. It's impossible to succeed in these levels realistically within the context of a traditional diet. Above all, the physiological effect of the many of those foods is usually short-lived. This suggests that folks will have to consume them frequently to require advantage of those nutrients' health benefits. This might have an adverse effect, especially in terms of certain foods: eating cocoa within the sort of frequent chocolate, for instance , will increase the intake of not only cocoa-promoting flavonoids, but also other nutrients that are recommended to be consumed less.

Looking at these studies, perhaps a good more important point to think about is that the majority studies tend to use either animal models like rats or in vitro experiments using isolated groups of human cells. Such research is beneficial to offer scientists a thought of what the health-related properties and physiological mechanisms of certain food ingredients might be; however, these components can't be bound to have an  equivalent effect on humans if consumed on a diet basis. Investigating the consequences of those foods on humans may be a complex task. The very fact that our diets, genes and lifestyles vary from person to person makes it difficult to research the health effects of nutrients. This suggests that, unlike research on cell culture and animals, a special approach is required when researching effects on humans. This approach should ideally include both intervening research (where researchers manipulate a diet to work out the effect of a food or nutrient) and observational research (where researchers observe the consequences of natural differences in people's diet).

</figure>

One last item to think about when watching research on "health" of foods is that a lot of researchers examine foods in isolation. Considering the very fact that folks normally consume various foods together, researching one food doesn't reflect actual human consumption. Moreover, there's evidence that eating food together in some cases actually enhances the body's ability to soak up nutrients, for instance , beta-carotene in carrots and spinach is simpler to soak up when eaten alongside an oil source like dressing . This means the advantages of a diet with a spread of nutritious foods versus a diet based only on one or more superfoods.



### Coming to the Conclusion

The idea that food has extraordinary benefits to health is extremely appealing and has increased the public's interest in superfoods. Indeed, scientific studies during this area have shown that certain ingredients of food and beverages could also be particularly good for us. This also manifests itself within the presence of approved health claims by the ecu Food Safety Authority (EFSA) that find relevant scientific evidence sufficiently convincing. However, it might not be realistic to expect a narrow range of 'super foods' to significantly improve our health. When watching the evidence behind superfoods, we'd like to be realistic about the way to transfer them to real diets.

Naming certain foods within the media as 'super' can also give the impression that other foods in our diet aren't that healthy. actually , however, these foods often provide nutrients as valuable as those found in superfoods. For instance , there are many nutrients that support health, like beta-carotene, fiber and flavonoid quercetin in carrots, apples, and onions. Whole grain sorts of cereal-based starch foods like bread, rice and pasta also are rich in fiber. In adults, daily dietary fiber intake should be a minimum of 25 g. Another advantage of these foods is that they're mostly cheap and always available easily. This suggests that we will easily consume these foods regularly and in sufficient quantities to form the foremost of the nutrient content. Considering that the majority of people in Europe don't eat enough vegetables and fruits to satisfy their daily dietary recommendations, raising our daily intake of varied vegetables and fruits will make excellent progress towards improving our health generally .

### Result
When it involves ensuring a balanced nutrient intake permanently health, we'd like to extend the variability of nutritious foods in our diet instead of focusing only on a couple of foods that's claimed to be 'super'. More importantly, our diet should contain more and more vegetables and fruits. Many European countries provide nutritional guidelines for food to assist people achieve this goal.
